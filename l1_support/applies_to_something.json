    "Symptoms": "On 11.5.10.2 in Production:\nWhen attempting to run a Supply Chain MRP plan the following error occurs in MRCNEW - Memory Based Planner.\n\nAPP-MRP-22086: mradfpalloc: Cannot allocate memory for fpalloc\n\nCause: The current routine cannot allocate memory for the specified entity.\n\nAction: Contact your customer support representative.\n\ngthsk1=243859\ngthsk2=7\ngthsk3=19\ngthsk4=48\ngthsk5=3\ngthsk6=3\nTotal memory usage: 2097120\nFreeing calendar memory\nFreeing memory for type 1 and org 105\nFreeing memory for type 2 and org 0\nFreeing memory for type 3 and org 103\nFreeing memory for 103 Period type:1\nFreeing memory for type 1 and org 103\nFreeing memory for 104 Period type:1\nFreeing memory for type 1 and org 104\nFreeing memory for 106 Period type:1\nFreeing memory for type 1 and org 106\nFreeing memory for 107 Period type:1\nFreeing memory for type 1 and org 107\n\nImportant:  Total memory usage: 2097120 - This shows the total memory useage of the plan in kbytes so this is about 2 Gig.  This is the limitation for data memory for regular MRP/Supply Chain Planning.  However in this case there were no new organizations or significant amounts of data added to the plan and previously this same plan completed with Total memory usage: 350702 which is about 350 Meg before it started to fail.  So it's clear that there's some type of data problem in the plan.   It's critical that support see the previous completed plan log file, for MRCNEW - Memory Based Planner - for the last successful run so that we can check on the memory useage and investigate appropriately.\n\nSTEPS\nThe issue can be reproduced at will with the following steps:\n1. Run the MRP Supply Chain Plan\n2. Plan fails with 2 gig limitation in MRCNEW\n3. The day before it failed it only took 350 Meg",
    "Cause": "In this case the calendar for one of the organizations attached to the plan was only extended and built out through 01-JAN-2010.  When the plan horizon date is beyond this date, the memory based planner goes into an infinite loop looking for calendar dates and will continue to do so until all of the 2 gig memory is used.\n\nA.  If you run the MRP Supply Chain Plan with MRP:Debug Mode = Yes might see the following shown literally thousands of times until the plan finally runs out of memory:\n\nbegin\n:var_output := dbms_lock.release(:var_handle);\nend;\n\nfp curr seq num = 238085501 fp max seq num = 238086000\ndeclare\nvar_handle1 varchar2(128);\nbegin\ndbms_lock.allocate_unique ('MRP_FP', var_handle1);\n:var_output := dbms_lock.request(var_handle1, 6, 32767, FALSE);\n:var_handle := var_handle1;\nend;\n\nB.  Just before the above we saw the last thing the plan was working on which led us to check the calendar for the problem organization:\n\nInitializing Sources for item 176698 Org 105\n  Org 103 Vendor -23453 Site -23453 Eff 2454012 Dis 999999999 Alloc percent 100.000000 AllocatedQty 0.000000\nPrevSchedOnHand 0.000000 schedDate 2455064\nPrevSchedOnHand 0.000000 schedDate 2455074\nPrevSchedOnHand 0.000000 schedDate 2455154\ndeclare\n\nIn the above it was working on an item in Org_id = 105.  When we checked with the following script we found the organization_code for this organization and then found this organization calendar was only built to 01-JAN-2010:\n\nselect organization_code, calendar_code\nfrom mtl_parameters\nwhere organization_id = 105;\n\nKeep the output for the next script\n\nselect min(calendar_date), max(calendar_date)\nfrom bom_calendar_dates\nwhere calendar_code = '&Cal_Code';\n\nInput the calendar code from the first script when prompted and found that max(calendar_date) was 01-JAN-2010",
    "Solution": "Perform the following:\n\n1. Extend and build the calendar for all organizations included in the plan at least 5 years into the future.\n\nA. BOM/Setup/Calendars - query and extend all Calendars for the organizations included in the plan name/options to at least 5 years in the future.\n\nB. Then from the Tool Bar select Tools/Build - make sure this concurrent request completes successfully\n\n3.
