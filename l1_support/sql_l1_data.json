The actual validation that takes place will be the same, whether done with Validate on Server set to  'Yes' or 'No'.\n\nAdditionally, If you are using flexfields server-side validation, you cannot use form field references (:block.field) on a Read only version.  \nYou must either remove your field references or turn off flexfields server-side validation.\n\nOne misconception is that this profile will turn off validation. It does NOT turn validation off.\nIts purpose is to help performance for users with wide-area network environments by reducing the network traffic associated with flex validation.  \n\nTo implement the solution, please follow below steps -\n\n1.

In order to use a particular item to define a new bill, certain criteria must be met.

Try querying the bill using the Bill Define form in an Engineering responsibility if trying to define the bill in a Manufacturing responsibility or vice-versa. If the bill is defined in Engineering, it can be transferred to Manufacturing if needed.\nIf the bill is being created in a Manufacturing responsibility, the item cannot be an engineering item.\nThe EAM_TYPE parameter** must be NULL or if defined with a value of 1 or 2, it must equal the item's EAM_ITEM_TYPE\nThe UNIT_EFF_FLAG parameter** must be 'Y' or if defined with a value of 'N', the item's\nEffectivity Control attribute must be set to 'Date' (1)\n \n\n**The EAM_TYPE and UNIT_EFF_FLAG parameters are passed to the form when opened.\nTo view their values, perform the following actions:\nUsing the responsibility and instance where you get the error, open the Bill Define form (Navigate: Bills > Bills)\nChoose the Help > Diagnostics > Examine pull down menu option (you will need access to do this)\nIn the field labeled \"Block\", use the LOV to choose \"PARAMETER\"\nIn the field labeled \"Field\", enter a parameter name to see its value (either EAM_TYPE or UNIT_EFF_FLAG)\nAfter entering, its defined value will display in the \"Value\" field",
